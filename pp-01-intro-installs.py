# Python requires installation and an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
# Python can be installed here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
# VS Code can be installed here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

# To confirm installation, type "python -V" at command line
# The first time writing Python in VS Code you may have to setup the Python Interpreter.
# This is typically easy - just follow the prompts!

# It's a good idea to pick a folder to work from, on your hard drive, before coding.
# C:\repos\python\python-primer would work for those wishing to push code to GitHub.
