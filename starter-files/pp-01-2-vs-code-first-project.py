# p. 6 - VS Code
# VS Code is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for many programming
# languages. It's not the only one for Python, but is my favorite!
# IDE's offer a lot of advantages in development:
# - syntax checking and highlighting
# - code completion, formatting assistance
# - many more!

# Close VS Code, reopen, open folder, and create hello-world script.
